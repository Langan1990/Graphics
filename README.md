## Introduction

The game I want to create is a cross between 2 classics, brick breaker and space invaders. It involves the user controlling a paddle at the bottom of the screen which can only move left and right.
The brick objects are your targets, you get 1 point for every brick you break.
It is going to be like space invaders in the way that the bricks are always going to be slowly falling to the bottom of the canvas.
When any brick reaches the bottom it is game over.
